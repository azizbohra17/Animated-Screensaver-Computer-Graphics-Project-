This project is a computer graphics implementation of the Royal Mint of Spain, inspired by the popular TV show "La Casa De Papel" (Money Heist). The project is developed in C programming language and aims to create a visual representation of the iconic building.

## Features

- Render a 2D model of the Royal Mint of Spain using computer graphics techniques.
- Implement realistic lighting effects to enhance the visual appeal of the scene..
- Added elements such as doors, windows, and other architectural features.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- OpenGL: A cross-platform graphics API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit): A library that provides a simple API for window management and user interaction.
